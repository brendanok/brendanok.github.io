About
</h1> <br>

<p>
Hello, I'm Brendan Ok. I'm currently a graduate student pursuing my masters in Economics at The University of Texas at Austin.
</p> <br>

<p>
I was previously employed by <a class= "plink" href="https://www.dooleytackaberry.com/" target="_blank">Dooley Tackaberry</a> in Deer Park, Texas
as a data analyst.
Before that, I graduated from Texas A&M University in May 2019 with a BS in Economics.
</p> <br>

<p>
I'm mostly interested in work using data and statistics. I spend a lot of my off-time
exercising and watching movies.
