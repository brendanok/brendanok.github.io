About
</h1>  <br>

<p>
Hello, I'm Brendan Ok, a data analyst based in Houston, Texas.
</p> <br>

<p>
I'm currently employed by <a class= "plink" href="https://www.dooleytackaberry.com/" target="_blank">Dooley Tackaberry</a> in Deer Park, Texas
as someone who mostly handles a lot of the company's business intelligence, analytics, report automation, and database management.
Before that, I graduated from Texas A&M University in May 2019 with a BS in Economics.
</p> <br>

<p>
I'm mostly interested in work regarding development economics, environmental sustainability, fitness,
and sports analytics. I spend a lot of my off-time
exercising, watching movies, and reading random Wikipedia articles.
